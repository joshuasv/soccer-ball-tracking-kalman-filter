# Soccer ball tracking with Kalman Filter

This implementation follows the approach presented in [1]. 

Furthermore, the approach was validated against the predictions of a pre-trained YOLOv4. Results can be found in the `report.pdf`.

I strongly recommend to those getting started with Kalman filters to give [2] a chance. Great quality material.
